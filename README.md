# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera 

In this repo, Iâ€™ve included all the programming projects for the deep learning specialization course I took on Coursera by the infamous AI pioneer Andrew Ng. The Specialization has five courses: 

 ## Course 1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS4cs9xVecg&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0)
